## Code Structure

- **Main Plugin File**: Contains hooks for setting up the plugin, creating menu pages, and registering AJAX functions.
- **AJAX Handlers**: Handles AJAX requests for adding employees, retrieving employee lists, and assigning tasks.
- **Admin Pages**: Each page (e.g., add employee, list employees) is a separate file included in the plugin.
- **CSS/JS**: Assets are enqueued only on relevant admin pages for efficient loading.

## AJAX Endpoints

- **Add Employee**: `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=add_new_employee`
- **Get All Employees**: `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_all_employee_details`
- **Add Task**: `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=add_task`
- **Load Employee Table**: `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=loadTable`

## Development Notes

- Nonces are used to verify AJAX requests for security.
- Custom database tables are recommended for storing employee and task data for scalability.
- CSS and JS dependencies, such as Bootstrap and jQuery, are enqueued only on plugin-related pages.
